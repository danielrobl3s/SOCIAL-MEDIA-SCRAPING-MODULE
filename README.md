# SOCIAL MEDIA SCRAPING MODULE
Web scrapers to social media (Facebook, Instagram and Tiktok)

# Read first before anything else
###### In order to get the whole code to work, you need to install 'requirements.txt' file, these are the dependencies needed for your python environment.

`python3 -m venv env` ---> Creates a new python virtual environment
`source env/scripts/activate` ---> Activates the recently created virtual environment (command may vary from windows, mac and linux or your specific file system)
`pip install -r requirements.txt` ---> Gets all the dependencies needed for this project

### Chrome driver installation:
This project uses selenium to work, which is a automated testing tool for chrome, chromedriver updates relatively often, you need to update it and add it to your path environment variable:

Download chromedriver at: https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/#stable

(latest stable version you can find)

save it whereever you want:

if you're currently having troubles with chromedrive related issues, please refer to chromedriver page troubleshooting section at: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/home#h.p_ID_60





### Data collecting module:

This module consists of 3 specific files: facebook_scraper.py, instagram_scraper.py and tiktok_scraper.py

To get each to work, simply run via command line:

## Facebook:
(WARNING) this scraper is the most problematic one since facebook suffered from data privacy lawsuits and is often updating their platform to make facebook a scraping-hostile platform, with this in mind, the .csv scraper might be wack specially with small facebook pages with few interactions

`py facebook_scraper.py`

You'll be asked to prompt the facebook page subdomain:
`$Introduce the website to be scraped: `
Enter the facebook subdomain (facebook page) you want to scrape:

then you'll be asked for the name of your document (csv) where your scraped data will be stored:

`$Name your csv file: `

Make sure to just write the name, the file type is .csv by default



## Instagram:
This is simpler than the facebook scraper, when executed, it types credentials into corresponding fields and goes over all posts individually to collect data and stores it into a csv file.

You'll be asked to prompt the Instagram account subdomain:
`$Introduce the website to be scraped:`

Enter the instagram account subdomain you want to scrape:

(Instagram account subdomain image)

then you’ll be asked for the name of your document (csv) where your scraped data will be stored:

`$Name your csv file:`

Make sure to just write the name, the file type is .csv by default

## Tiktok:
This scraper is a little tricky, you execute the tiktok_scraper.py file and then selenium opens the chrome browser and immediately you will be promted with a CAPTCHA alike popup, you'll need to pass through manually:

as the instagram scraper this one works alike, it goes over each post and collects titles, likes, comments and number of saves

You'll be asked to prompt the tiktok account subdomain:
`$Introduce the website to be scraped:`

Enter the tiktok account subdomain you want to scrape:

(tiktok account subdomain image)

then you’ll be asked for the name of your document (csv) where your scraped data will be stored:

`$Name your csv file:`

Make sure to just write the name, the file type is .csv by default
